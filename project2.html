           Shown below is an image of a printer, specifically the toner of a printer. This is to display all of the troubleshooting me 
        and my coworkers do on printers, as they are one of the key machines that help out a hospital with producing documentation.</menu>

How?
        </h2>
        <h3>
          The way this project is completed is either by the individual person filing a ticket to support, or by us getting a package from shipping and recieving.
          When either of these happen, we go down and investigate what is going on with the printer. If we get a package, it is more than likely it is low on toner and we
          shall use the package of toner we recieved to replace it. If it is a ticket, we will always try to print out the configuration of the printer and go from there to find 
          any issues.
        </h3>

            Application?
                    </h2>
                    <h3>
                        This is allowing me to configure and troubleshoot all different kinds of printers, and be able to analyze how to solve each individual issue.
                        From toners to configurations to jamming, the application and experience I am getting is helping me figure all of this out.
