           Below is a box full of Degaussed hard drives. This means that these hard drives did not work, or were seen as unusable/unnecessary to have, so they were
        demagnetized and disposed of.</menu>

How?
        </h2>
        <h3>
          This was achieved by obtaining hard drives from various sources and learning that they are not useable or no longer needed.
          When I learned about this information, I was able to take these to a desgausser that we have in the workroom. A degausser is a machine that demagnetizes Hard Drives, rendering the information on them destroyed and unobtainable.
          Once I run them through the machine, they are documented within an Microsoft Excel sheet and then tossed into boxes, before taken away to be destroyed physically.
        </h3>

            Application?
                    </h2>
                    <h3>
                        The application is that this shows me the pratical way you can destroy information that is not physical. It also shows me how 
                        companies are able to destroy confidential information without having any harm or risk of losing it. Keeping it documented, demagnetized, and destroyed.
